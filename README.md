# Assassin Game

## Learning Ruby

This assassin game started as my first CRUD app. From there, I gained interest from a few of my fellow Dev Bootcamp students who also wanted to help create the game! It is still in progress (please remember, it was the first CRUD app for the entire team!), but you can check out the game as is on
[Heroku](dbc-assassin-game.herokuapp.com).

## Overview

Assassin is a live action game you can play with a group of friends or strangers. In this game, a group of people are placed in round robin order and each assigned a target. When you "kill" your target you acquire your victim's target, and so on until there is only one person left standing.

The organization for Assassin typically require a Game Master, or someone who is aware of who is assigned to kill who. With this web app, that is no longer necessary! Here are a few screenshots of the game.
